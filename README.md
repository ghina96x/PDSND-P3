Project Title:
Udacity Bike-Share Project

Description:
The project consists of Python code that imports data from data bases on bike-share usage in Chicago, New York City and Washington.
Several descriptive statistics are calculated based on user input. The user can decide which city, month and day to inspect. The statistics illustrate popular routes, times of travel and customer characteristics.

Files used
There are three files: new_york_city.csv, chicago.csv, and washington.csv

Credits
Thank you to Udacity for creating the challenging project.
